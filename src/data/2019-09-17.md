Jason Klitenic, General Counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, sends a letter to Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, denying that the whistleblower complaint will be released to Congress today, and stating that appearing before the committee on <a href="#2019-09-19">19 September, 2019</a> would be "premature."
